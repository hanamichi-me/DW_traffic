--Query 3: Which months have the highest number of fatal crashes, and is there a seasonal pattern? Would analyzing time of day enhance this insight?
SELECT
  d.month,
  COALESCE(t.time_of_day, 'All Times') AS time_of_day,   -- Label nulls in time_of_day

HAVING GROUPING(d.month) + GROUPING(t.time_of_day) < 2   -- Exclude grand total (null-null)
